# Bank_loan-Default-Predicting
We use the bank_loan data and logestic model to give default prediction.
This prohect contains three parts:
  1. data preparation
  2. logestic modelling
  3. model evaluation

Detailed discription of each part
A. Data Preparation: 
  a. check the type of each variable
  b. deal with missings
  c. decide which variables we will use and which variables we will drop and give explanations.
  d. split the dataset into two sub-datasets, the training dataset and the testing dataset. Make sure these two datasets have a samilar default probability.
  
B. Logestic modelling:
