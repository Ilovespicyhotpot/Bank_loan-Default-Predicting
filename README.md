Our aim is to develop a logistic regression model to estimate a bank loan default using the application based and behavioral information of the loan. We use the historical bank personal loan data available online to arrive at the target default (0 or 1) value for each of the loan account. We will further go ahead and build a score card for the personal loan segment, which allows the credit manager to arrive at the scoring for each loan application.
The project has four parts:
1. Data Preparation & Variable Selection
2. Modelling & Model Selection
3. Prediction & Model Evaluation
4. Scorecard

1. Data Preparation: Missings/ Outliers/ Influencials/ Multicollinearity 
2. Model Selection: Anova test
3. Prediction & Model Evaluation: ROC curve
4. Scorecard: WOE transformation/ Scoring model
